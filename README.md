# Rome-car-accidents

Using the observed outcomes of the number of car accidents in Rome in 2021 a complete Bayesian analysis is carried out with a conditionally i.i.d. Poisson distribution statistical model. In particular we will carry out:
- an Exploratory Data Analysis 
- a fully Bayesian Analysis (Likelihood, Prior distribution, Posterior update, etc...)
- point estimates 
- interval estimates
- a study of the posterior predictive distribution 

### What's in here?
